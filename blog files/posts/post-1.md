# Engineering Oversights and the art of error making

First and foremost to everyone reading this, Happy New Year!

May this year bring peace, prosperity and certain enlightenment to you and your family.

As we go into the two-thousandth-and-twenty-fifth year, we must keep in mind all the giants whose shoulders we stand on.

It was in this mindset of gratefullness and humilty that I barged into the bathroom stalls here at Grinnell, thinking of all the trials-and-errors that engineers and physists encounter in their attemptes to make sense of the world that I noticed a hilarious and glaringly obvious oversight. 

In order to keep students from falling ill, messages informing the usefullness of proper hygine are installed on the mirror, in a humble font on see-through stickers.

As Euclid noted, the angle at which light scatters off a mirror is equal to the angle at which it first coincided with the mirror, which he called the law of reflection. It is from the law of reflection that we know that mirrors behave differently depending on the position of the observer. 

While I am sure the person in charge of public hygine was well intentioned, the lettering on their stickers is hilariously obscured when observed from any point of view other than directly infront of them.

This oversight in itself is not particularly remarkable, however what is truly to be appreciated is the humility of whoever was in charge of the whole effort, as new stickers featuring black text on a white background can be seen just beside the original underthought effort.

I have attached images of both the signs in their full glory to this blog post.

Little mistakes like these remind me that the true glory is in failure. It is useless, in scientific persuit, for things to work out as we formulate them. It is oversights like these that lead to the genisis of the most profound ideas to grace our blue pebble. And it is humility that allows us to learn.
